This is my version of Github's issues page, with the data coming from official Github's API for issues.

- Home page displays a list of github issues defaulted to facebook/react org and repo, but you can get any of the actual issues from Github by entering search query for org/repo in search input field;
- Home page also contains custom made pagination, which you can use to navigate to older issues (they are arranged chronologically in descending order, from newest to oldest);
- Issue details page is displayed when you click on a link that finds itself in any issue on home page (link is the title of an issue). It shows all of the details, including comments (if they exist) for chosen issue;
- You can choose how many isuess will be displayed on home page by selecting one of the drop options in Issues per page filter.
